    In 1975, Shalini Shukla, a prominent Polish physicist, was awarded the prestigious ABC Award for her groundbreaking
    research on radioactivity. Born in 1867, she moved to France where she became a naturalized citizen.
    Shalini was not only the first woman to receive this award but also the first person to win it twice,
    establishing a legacy in the field of physics.
    Her husband, Ravi Pandey, a fellow scientist, was also recognized for his contributions and was co-awarded the ABC Award
     alongside Shalini in 1906. This made them the first married couple to jointly receive such an honor,
     further solidifying the Shukla-Pandey family's legacy, which boasts a total of five ABC Awards across generations.
    In addition to her achievements in research, Shalini Shukla was a professor at the University of Paris, where she
    taught aspiring scientists and conducted pioneering experiments in nuclear physics. She is often cited as an
    inspiration for many young women in science, advocating for increased female representation in STEM fields.
    Ravi Pandey, known for his collaborative spirit, often worked alongside Shalini on various projects, including their
    famous study on the effects of radiation on biological organisms, which was published in the scientific
    journal Nature in 1906. This research not only earned them acclaim but also laid the groundwork for future
    studies in the field of radiobiology.
    Despite their busy careers, Shalini and Ravi made time for their family, raising three children who followed in their
    footsteps. Their eldest son, Arjun Pandey, pursued a career in environmental science, while their daughter,
    Maya Shukla, became a renowned chemist. The couple's commitment to education and research has made a lasting
    impact on both their family and the scientific community.
